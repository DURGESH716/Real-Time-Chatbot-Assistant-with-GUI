# Real Time Chatbot Assistant with Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## What is a chatbot?
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be as simple as any programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or in detail as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.

You’ve probably interacted with a chatbot whether you know it or not. For example, you’re at your computer researching a product, and a window pops up on your screen asking if you need help, Or you might have used voice commands to order a coffee from your neighborhood cafe and received a response telling you when your order will be ready and what it will cost.

## How do Chatbots work?
Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), automated rules, natural-language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML), chatbots process data to deliver responses to requests of all kinds.
There are two main types of chatbots.

### 1) Task-oriented (declarative) chatbots 
These are single-purpose programs that focus on performing one function. Using rules, NLP, and very little ML, they generate automated but conversational responses to user inquiries. Interactions with these chatbots are highly specific and structured and are most applicable to support and services like interactive FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions).

### 2) Data-driven and predictive (conversational) chatbots 
These are often referred to as virtual assistants or digital assistants, and they are much more sophisticated, interactive, and personalized than task-oriented chatbots. These chatbots are contextually aware and leverage natural-language understanding (NLU), NLP, and ML to learn as they go. Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are examples of consumer-oriented, data-driven, predictive chatbots.
